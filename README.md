## Usage

You can run this project with ***```install.sh```*** file but I suggest you to using ***```manager.sh```*** because this file is created for managing project in easiest way.

***Tip: install.sh is already using manager.sh for running project!***

## Run
```bash
./install.sh
```

## Suggested run method
```bash
./manager.sh start
```

You can use ***```./manager.sh```*** without params to see help of usage.
